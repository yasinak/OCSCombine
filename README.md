# OCSTest
This project has the ambition to show my capabilities to develop an iOS iPhone OCS application.
The first view show the result of a user movie or TV show search.
And the details as the details of a search.

## Prerequisite
You need to install the last Xcode from Apple Store.

## How to Use
To open the project, double click to OCSTest.xcodeproj file, Xcode will be launch. After you can run the project and test it on a simulator.

## Artichecture
The project used a MVVM architecture, with Combine framework.
I choose this architecture because it is sufficient for the need of this little project, and because with Combine, it is well formated.

## Test
A lot a of test is missing.

## Improvement
We can add behavior when the search fetch 0 result.
We can add more test especially on the bing function.
